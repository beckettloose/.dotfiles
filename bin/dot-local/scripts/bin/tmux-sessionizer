# tmux-sessionizer
#
# Originally written by ThePrimeagen
# Heavily modified by Beckett Loose
#
# Allows the user to quickly create and navigate between tmux sessions that are
# tied to the folders of individual projects. It is highly recommended to map
# this script to a keyboard shortcut such as <C-f> in your shell profile and
# tmux config for quick access.
#
# When this script is executed, it searches the list of provided directories for
# all subdirectories or symlinks to directories with a depth of 1. The user is
# then prompted to select a directory with an fzf prompt. Once the user selects
# a directory, a tmux session corresponding to it will be created (or attached,
# if it already exists). All shell instances created in this session will
# default to the selected directory for convenience.

# check if we have 1 argument
if [[ $# -eq 1 ]]; then
    # if the first argument == 1, then we have already windowized ourself
    if [[ $1 -eq 1 ]]; then
        :
    fi
# if we don't have an argument and we are in tmux, open as a new window in the
# active tmux session and run this script with the tmux flag set, then exit.
